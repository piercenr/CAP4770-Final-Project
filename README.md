Data Analysis Project: Predicting Future Fares for Transit Systems

Authors: Juan Salas Paredes, Piercen Rychlik

Overview:

This repository contains the code and documentation for a data analysis project conducted by Juan Salas Paredes and Piercen Rychlik. The project aimed to predict future fares for transit systems using data obtained from The Federal Transit Administration. The data was analyzed, and various machine learning models were developed to create predictive algorithms.

Data Source:

The data utilized in this project was sourced from The Federal Transit Administration. It included historical information on transit fares, ridership, demographic data, and other relevant factors for the transit systems within the city/state.

Methodology:

Data Preprocessing: The raw data was cleaned, normalized, and prepared for analysis. Missing values were handled appropriately, and features were engineered as needed.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical analysis were performed to gain insights into the dataset. This step involved understanding the relationships between different variables and identifying patterns.

Model Development: Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated to predict future transit fares. Models included linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and potentially more complex algorithms like neural networks.

Model Evaluation: The models were assessed based on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Cross-validation techniques were used to ensure robustness and prevent overfitting.

Visualization: Visual graphs were created to illustrate the performance of the models and showcase the predicted fare trends over time. These visualizations provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the projected outcomes.

Conclusion:

This data analysis project undertaken by Juan Salas Paredes and Piercen Rychlik aimed to provide insights into future transit fares for the city/state transit systems. Through meticulous data analysis, model development, and visualization, we have constructed a robust algorithm that can assist in predicting future fare trends. The results and methodologies presented here serve as a foundation for further research and decision-making processes within the transit industry.
